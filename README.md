# theBoysProject

## Description

This project involves simulating a world with heroes, bases, and missions. Each hero has a set of abilities, an experience level, and other attributes.

Bases are scattered throughout the world, and heroes periodically move between them. Each base has a maximum capacity and a waiting queue; upon arriving at the base, a hero can choose to wait in line or give up, traveling to another base. Each base has a gatekeeper who manages the entry/exit of heroes and the waiting queue.

Missions sporadically arise in random locations in this world; each mission requires a specific set of skills. The mission can be attended by a team of heroes located at a base, provided that the heroes in the team collectively possess the required skills. When chosen to participate in a mission, each hero earns experience points.

This project aims to simulate the dynamics of this world over the course of a year (525,600 minutes). At the end of the simulation, it should provide the number of missions completed (points earned) for each hero and other statistics.
